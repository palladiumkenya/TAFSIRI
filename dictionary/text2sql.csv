The dataset contains clients outcome and other clinical Indicators as at the end of month of the latest reporting month (the date is contained in the dataset).  Do not query this DB on quetions related to HIV testing, HEI , PNS. 
  To calculate unsuppression or non-suppression rate, Numerator is valid vl(HasValidVL)and unsuppressed(Validvlsup=0) and the denominator is valid vl (HasValidvl=1).
To calculate suppression rate, Numerator is valid suppressed(Validvlsup=1) and the denominator is valid vl (HasValidvl=1).""
To calculate IIT rate , Numerator is (ARTOutcomeDescription = Loss to follow up)  and the denominator is (ARTOutcomeDescription= loss to follow up and Active).
The key difference is that the ""Differentiated Care"" column refers to a model of multi-month dispensing, whereas ""ONMMD"" specifically denotes multi-month dispensing itself.
When creating SQL queries involving 'txcurr' or its synonymous terms ('active patients on treatment' or 'current on ART'), always apply a filter to select records with IsTxcurr = 1. This ensures that the query results only include patients who are currently receiving treatment.

Some of the questions to be asked from this table; 
1. How many active clients have unsuppressed viral load in Nairobi County?""
2. ""What is the vl suppression rate by county""
3. ""What is the txcurr by county""
4. ""among active patients on treatment, how many clients were screened for depression, calculate proportions by county.?""
5. ""Among patients who started ART less than 3 months ago, what proportion have Advanced HIV Disease(AHD)""? hint numerator is AHD = 1, denominator is all, where StartARTDate and current date is less tha 3 months. calculate proportion
6. Number of txcurr clients eligible for VL? hint ; numerator Eligible4VL=1 denominator is all where txcurr=1
7. ""What is the proportion of txcurr who were screened for Hypertensive in the last visit? 
8. ""What proportion of TxCurr,  have hypertension"", 
9. ""What proportion of TxCurr patients a) Have Diabeted b)Have diabetes contolled""
10. ""what proportion of txcurr patients,have not been verified by County""
11. ""What is the proportion of txcurr are on  DTG based regimen by age categories.""



You can be asked to calculate proportions;
Example 1 : If a user asks, ""What is unsuppression rate by county"", your system should generate a SQL query like: SELECT County, COUNT(*) AS TotalPatientsWithValidVL, COUNT(CASE WHEN HighViremia = 1 THEN 1 END) AS UnsuppressedPatients, COUNT(CASE WHEN HighViremia = 1 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS UnsuppressionRate FROM Linelist_FACTART WHERE ISTxCurr = 1 AND HasValidVL = 1 GROUP BY County;
 Example 2: Verified and CURRENT ON ART  as at June 2024 
SQL query like:SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalVerifiedAndCurrentOnART
FROM Linelist_FACTART
WHERE Nupi IS NOT NULL
AND ISTxCurr = 1
